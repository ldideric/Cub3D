Executable name
Check that the project compiles well (without re-link) when you excute the `make`
command and that the executable name is `cub3D`.
Configuration file
Check that you can configure ALL the following elements in the configuration file.
The formating has to be as described in the subject.

- the image resolution/window size - R
- north texture path - NO
- east texture path - EA
- south texture path - SO
- west texture path - WE
- sprite texture path - S
- floor color - F
- ceilling color - C
- the map (see subject for the map configuration details)

Also check that the program returns an error and exits properly when
the configuration file is misconfigured (for example an unknow key, double keys,
an invalid path..) or if the filename doesn't end with the `.cub` extension.

If not, the defence is over and the final grade will be 0.
Technical elements of the display
We're going to evaluate the technical elements of the display. Run the
program and execute the 5 following tests. If at least one
fails, no points will be awarded for this section. Move to the next one.

- A windows must open at the launch of the program if the `--save` argument is not supplied.
It must stay open during the whole execution and have the resolution as set in the configuration file.

- An image representing the inside of a maze must be displayed inside the window.

- When the argument `--save` is supplied, the program won't open a window but output a file in bmp format
with the resolution as defined in the configuration file (R key).
Note that a subprocess opening up in the dock is not the same as a window.

- Hide all or part of the window either by using another window
or by using the screen's borders, then minimize the windows
and maximize it back. In all cases the content of the window
must remain consistent.

- Set a resolution (R key) in the config file greater than the actual screen resolution.
The program must resize the window to fit the screen resolution.
User basic events
In this section we're going to evaluate the program's user
generated events. Execute the 3 following tests. If at least one
fails, this means that no points will be awarded for this section.
Move to the next one.

- Click the red cross at the top left of the window. The
window must close and the program must exit cleanly.

- Press the ESC key. The window must close and the program
must exit cleanly. In the case of this test, we will accept
that another key exits the program, for example Q.

- Press the four arrow keys (we'll accept WASD or ZQSD keys)
in the order of your liking. Each keypress must render a
visible result on the window, such as a player's movement/rotation.
Movements
In this section we'll evaluate the implementation of player's movement/orientation inside the maze.
Execute the 5 following tests. If at least one fails, this means that no points will be awarded for this section.
Move to the next one.

- The player's spawning orientation on the first image must be in accordance
with the configuration file, test for each cardinal orientation (N, S, E, W).

- Press the left arrow (or A or Q) then the right arrow
(or D). The player's view must rotate to the left
then to the right as if the player’s head was moving.

- Press the up arrow (or W or Z) then the down arrow (or S).
The player's view must go forward and then backward in a
straight line.

- Press A or Q (or the left arrow) then D (or the right arrow).
The player's view must go to the left and then to the right in a
straight line.

- During those four movements, was the display smooth? By
smooth we mean is the game "playable" or is it slow.
Walls & Sprites

In this section we'll evaluate the walls and sprites implementation in the maze.
Execute the 5 following tests. If at least one
fails, this means that no points will be awarded for this section.
Move to the next one.

- The walls texture vary depending on which compass point the wall is facing
(north, south, east, west).
Check that the textures on the walls and perspective are
clearly visible and correct.

- Check that if you modify the path of a wall texture or sprite image in the configuration file,
it actually modifies the rendered texture or sprite when the program is re-executed.

- Also check that if you set a non-existant path it raises an error.

- Check that the sprite is displayed correctly and that it can be present multiple times in the same map.

- Check that the floor and ceilling colors are well handled when you modify them in the configutation file.
Error management
In this section, we’ll evaluate the program's error management
and reliability. Execute the 4 following tests. If at least one
fails, this means that no points will be awarded for this section.
Move to the next one.

- Run the program using numerous arguments and random values.
Even if the program doesn't require any arguments, it is
critical that those arguments don’t alternate or create
unhandled errors.

- Check that there are no memory leaks. You can use the
`top` or `leaks` command in another shell to monitor that the memory
use is stable. The memory used must not increase each time an
action is made.

- Roll either your arm or your face on the keyboard. The program
must not show any strange behaviors and it must stay functional.

- Modify the map. The program must not show any strange behaviors
and it must stay functional if the map is well configured, if not it must raise an error.
Bonus
We will look at your bonuses if and only if your mandatory part is excellent. This means that you must complete the mandatory part, beginning to end, and your error management must be flawless, even in cases of twisted or bad usage. So if the mandatory part didn't score all the point during this defence bonuses will be totally ignored.

When i'll be older i'll be John Carmack
Look at the subject bonus part and add one point for each bonus
implemented and fully functionnal.
Rate it from 0 (failed) through 5 (excellent)

And more?
Same as before, but add one point when two more bonuses of
the list are well implemented and fully functionnal. Round it
up if necessary (9 bonuses is 5/5).
